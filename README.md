# Depop-scraper
 
# How to use

Use the create_seller_list.py file. Variables to change are:

base_url - this is the url of the product search you want to scrape sellers from

max_scroll_count - this is the number of pages that will be loaded before scraping data and dictates how many produts are scraped, if you are trying to solve for a number of products/sellers 'n' the number of scrolls should be n/24. 

csv_save_location - this is where the csv containing seller data will be save, probably easiest to point this to your Downlods folder (C:\\Users\\[YOUR USER]\\Downloads)
